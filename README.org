* Crontab-Friendly Git Update
A trivial shell script to facilitate pushing a Git repo via =crontab(8)=. A line similar to
#+BEGIN_SRC 
22 2 * * * $HOME/bin/auto-git-push $HOME/my-repo
#+END_SRC
in your =crontab= will cause the repo at =$HOME/my-repo= to be pushed every day at 2:22 AM.

The meat of the script executes these commands:
#+BEGIN_SRC shell-script
cd "$1"
git add -A .
git commit -q -m 'automated update'
git push -q
#+END_SRC

The =-q= flags will silence =git= unless an error occurs. This prevents =crontab= from sending email unless an actual error has occurred.

The script also tries to set a reasonable =PATH=. My guess is that this script will run on *NIX systems without modification. I'll leave configuring it for Cygwin as an exercise to the reader :-)
